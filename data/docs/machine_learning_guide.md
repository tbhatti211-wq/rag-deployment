# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following pre-written instructions, ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from labeled training data
- **Examples**: Classification, Regression
- **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
- **Use Cases**: Email spam detection, price prediction, image recognition

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Examples**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- **Algorithms**: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders
- **Use Cases**: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, data compression

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction with environment
- **Examples**: Game playing, robotics, recommendation systems
- **Algorithms**: Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks
- **Use Cases**: Self-driving cars, game AI, resource management

## Key Concepts

### Overfitting vs Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model performs poorly on both training and new data
- **Solution**: Cross-validation, regularization, proper model complexity

### Feature Engineering
- **Definition**: Process of selecting and transforming variables for ML models
- **Techniques**: Normalization, encoding categorical variables, feature selection
- **Importance**: Directly impacts model performance

### Model Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
- **Methods**: Train/Test split, Cross-validation, Confusion Matrix
- **Best Practices**: Use multiple metrics, avoid data leakage
